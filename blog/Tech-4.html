  <p>These problems unfortunately dont seem simple yet and i dont belive i answered any code in a elegant way but im getting there, im learning to persevere most of all.<br>
      Javascript is still very foreign for me, but i will practice and adapt. A simple problem like capitalize the first letter in an array of strings and im stumped.<br>
      Although i can read the code and understand it, so im sure it wont be long till im writing my own.<p><br>
        <p><strong>Psudocode</strong><br>
          Psudocode is to write code in plain english so you can see the problem as a simpler more cohesive whole which you can then work though step by step.<br>
          I need to use more Psudocode for problem solving.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Try something</strong><br>
Im not as confident in this approach yet as i feel i have to learn more javascript before its of use.</p>
<br>
<strong>Rubber Ducky Method</strong><br>
I like this method, my poor cat does not.
Quite often i run into problems because i read over everything too quickly.<br> The rubber ducky method helps you slow down and really realise where the problems lay.<br>
The Rubber ducky method is to remove your self from the problem and describe it in simple terms to another, (or a rubber duck) forcing you to re sea the whole problem but from a different mindset<br><br>
<strong>Reading error messages</strong><br>
Im somewhat confident in this, it depends on the error message though.<br> I am improving though, every new error message is a new one learnt.<br><br>
<strong>Console.logging</strong><br>
Im also somewhat confident in console.logging. I actually made my own js files to play with the console.log as i felt like i had only used it as a gimic and not from scratch on my own project.<br>
this helped alot but i would like more practice.<br>
<br>
<strong>Googling</strong><br>
  This has been my main source of imformation and answers, the more i google too the more i find that every coder relies on google.
  <br> This makes me feel more confident.<br><br>
<strong>Asking peers for help</strong><br>
I need to do more of this, sometimes i feel il answer my question quicker through google though.<br><br>
<strong>Asking Coaches for help</strong><br>
Ive reached out to my facilitator only a few times and should do more.<br><br>
<strong>Improving your process with reflection</strong>
This is something im trying to do, my entire camera roll on my phone is snipets of code i want to continue to learn from
