<h1>What are the best practices with using classes vs. ids? </h1>
<br>
<p id=header>
  Firstly what is a class and what is an id and why are they used?
  Classes and ids are basically containers,<br>
  you use said containers to organize and group your code, these containers are mainly used for styling purposes, <br>
  an ID is a more specific container used for a single line of code, think of it like a personalized name or label,<br> while a class is far broader,
  a class can be applied to as many items as you want, its in the name yet again, <br>a class is like this cohort it contains many different people . Its worth noting that is you apply<br> a class to an item with an id
  and they conflict the id will overide the class not vice versa. </p>
