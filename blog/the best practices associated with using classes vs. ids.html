<h1>What are the best practices with using classes vs. ids? </h1>
<br><br>

<p id=header>
  Firstly what is a class and what is an id and why are they used?
  Classes and ids are basically containers,<br>
  you use said containers to organize and group your code, these containers are mainly used for styling purposes, <br>
  an ID is a more specific container used for a single line of code, think of it like a personalized name or label,<br> while a class is far broader,
  a class can be applied to as many items as you want, its in the name yet again, <br>a class is like this cohort it contains many different people .
  Its worth noting that is you apply<br> a class to an item with an id
  and they conflict the id will overide the class not vice versa. </p>

  <p>in this first example i use a class to change the color of the hyperlink's text, i wanted to change the color of the text <br>for h1 and h3,
     if i used an ID i would have had to give them both unique names and re write the same line of code.<br>
     Hence why i used a class as i can kill two birds with one stone and save time</p>

<br>
    <p> In this example i use a id to change the font size of my paragraph i could have used a class but needed an example.<br>
      To sum up, Ids and classes are used to organize code into neat little packages, ids are like barcodes they apply only<br> to one item
      while a class can be applied to multiple items, you then use said tags to style the item/items
