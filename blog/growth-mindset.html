<h1>Growth mindsets</h1>
<p><Strong>What is a growth mindset and why is it important?</strong><br><br>
A growth mindset is to belive that most abilities can be developed through hard work and dedication (like an rpg game).<br>
Having a growth mindset helps one enjoy the process of learning and focus on the big picture, it also helps build mental resilience.<br>
<br>
<strong>In this exloration what suprised you?</strong>
<br>
Im suprised this isnt part of the circiclum for most main stream schooling. I think it would help everyone in every walk of life regardless of if they are studying.<br>
A growth mindset is so simple its almost common sense its a pity our society doesnt have more of a focus on general positive thinking.<br>
 It would have definietly helped me a million times over when i was young.<br><br>

 I will intergrate a growth mindest into my own learning journey by reminding myself daily to stick at things, remember that learning is hard but the challenge should be enjoyable.<br>
 Practice makes perfect, every second i spend focused on my goals adds up. Im im struggling rememeber every set back/hurdle is there to be learnt from.</p>
