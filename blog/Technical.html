    <p><strong>What is the difference between HTML and CSS?</strong><br>
      If html and css were a house, Html would be the foundations, general layout and building materials. CSS would dictate the colour of the walls and general design.</p><br>


      <p><strong>Control flow and loops in everyday life</strong><br>
        Control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements, loops are structures you use to repeat or "loop" a section of code before returning to the flow.<br>
        An example of this in everyday life would be making a Peanut butter sandwich, the given control flow of a sandwich is bread/filling/bread without this order its not a sandwich,<br>
        the loop in this scenario is spreading the Peanut butter you can loop this step and many times as you like (depending on your love for peanut butter).</p>

<p><strong>What is the DOM? Why would you use it?</strong><br>
  The DOM or (Document Object Model) is a tool used by developers to interact with their code. DOM is not a programming language but a object oriented representaion of the said webpage/code.<br>
  The DOM will list the document as a tree like structure which branchs into nodes that all store objects. One of the ways you can access the DOM is though chrome Developer tools.<br> An example of when you might use the DOM
  is to merely edit the background colour of the webpage to see how it looks, *note all edits made though the DOM will be reset on refresh and only apply to you, unless you you set a Chrome Workspace.<br>
  Another reason you would use a DOM is to access the Console so you can run any Javascript your working on. You can also use the DOM on websites you dont own allowing you to reverse engineer making it a great learning tool.</p>

  <p><strong>What is the difference between accessing data from Arrays and Objects?</strong><br>
Objects and Arrays are both very similar in many ways, they are both used to store mutable Data.
So whats the difference? Objects are used to store data when you have a clearly defined lable or class, the data stored in said object doesnt have to be read or organised in any order.
To access data stored in a object you simply input its value. If the object was called "cakeRecipes" and i wanted the brownie i would input "cakeRecipes.brownie" or "cakeRecipes['brownie']" .
Arrays on the other hand are best used when organising data by order, for example if i had an array called "cakeRecipes" and in this array i had [shortCake] [spongeCake] [chocolateCake] and [brownie] to accsess the brownie i would input,
"cakeRecipes[3]" or if i wanted the shortCake receipe i would input "cakeRecipes[0]" *note you count from 0 not 1 </p><Br>

  <p><strong>What is a function and why is it used?</strong><br>
A function is a set of statements that can perform a task. <br>A Javascript function executes when called. You use a function to create intricate systems that perform tasks,
these tasks can be as simple as greeting visitors to your webpage.<br> These functions can become far more complex
functions allow us to organise and re use code
