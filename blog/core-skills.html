  <h1>Core Skills</h1>

  <p><strong>What are three things you learned about your ego?</strong><br>
    I learned that discussing my emotions in a professional sense is terrifying, im getting better. <br>
    Starting new things is a big fear and self confidence is'nt the best. Ive been stuck in the same routine for such a long time so its nice to branch out and realise these things.<br><br>

    <strong>What are the role of values and empathy in programming?</strong><br>
    Just like any work enviroment being concious of the people around you and yourself is paramount, Especially in an industry like programming, <br>
    programming is all about creating and solving problems this creates a tonne of emotions. <br>The more patient and empathic you can be the better.<br>
    <br>
    <strong>What has suprised you the most about the core learning?</strong>
    <br>
    The thing that actually suprised me the most is how tricky i find the core learning programme.<br>
    Had you asked me before what i would have found the easiest i would have definietly said the core learning will be a breeze.<br>
    In saying that im glad its part of the programme.<br><br>
    <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of core learning?</strong><br>
    Im a feeling over thinking person. I have a hard time communicating whats going on in my head. <br>
    I am very intospective externalizing these thoughts is a real struggle, i think this is something that will always be a struggle to an extent, <br>
    either way i want to work on it.<br><br>
    <strong>Why the big focus on core learning?</strong><br>
    Programming is naturally quite a defeating past time if you dont approach it from the right angle.<br>
    Like discussed in earlier sprints students learn far more when they approach learning with a growth mindset.<br>
    The core programe is here to help us see EDA as a journey rather than a black and white picture.<br><br>
    <strong>Does the time spent studying core learning feel like a waste of time?</strong><br>
    No im glad its a focus, it will help me in all aspect of my personal and work life.<br>
    I feel that i wasted some time but only because it takes me so long to answer some of these questions.<br>
    The core learning will help me objectivly complete my goals.</p><br><br>

    <h1>Bootcamp Prep</h1><br>
    <p><strong>What is your long term goal/career pathway?</strong><br>
      Im still unsure as to my career pathway, I want a job that i find satisfying, i want a job i can contiune to improve and finesse.<br>
      Being paid well and having enough time to pursue my own personal hobbies is a must,<br>
       the likely hood of remote working in this industry really appeals to me.<br>
        Either way coding is something i want to continue to learn with or without a coding job.<br><br>
        <strong>What do you think your biggest strengths and weaknesses will be?</strong><br>
        im feeling that i may be a little behind everyone else come bootcamp as i havent been as punctual with my study slots as i wanted. <br>
        I atribute this to managing my own time for the first time in about 9 years, <br>
        its something id obviously have to get good at if i ever did find a job in this industy but im confident i could.<br>
        Some times its best to learn in the heat of things i find.
        Im not sure what my biggest strength will be, i like to think i will be joy to work with.<br><br>
        <strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge will be?</strong><br>
        I think my biggest challenge will be finding enough time between days to recharge, im an introvert and social interactions are nice but leave me exhausted.
        <br><br>
        <strong>What humnan skills would you like to develop while at EDA?</strong>
        <br>
        I want to work on my self confidence and self motivation. I want to get better at asking for help.<br><br>
        <strong>What are your expectaions of yourself during bootcamp?</strong><br>
        I expect myself to be in the right frame of mind to learn and work hard, i want to eat and sleep well and look after myself. <br>
        I want to bookend each day with something that helps me recharge. I expect myself to not miss a day and be on time.</p>
