  <h1>
    <em>Learning Plan</em>
    </h1>
    <p><strong>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</strong>
<br>
My long term goal is to find a career i can constantly improve in we spend so much of our lives working <br>it may as well be in something you can finesse, i want to feel mentally stimulated in my personal and work life<br>
my dream job would be ideally be one where i can set my own schedule and work from home. <br>I want it to be something i can be proud of.
</p>
<p>
  <strong> What non-technical skills would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</strong><br>
  I think i need to learn to be more self disciplined i need to work on self motivation, self esteem. I want to prove to myself that i can do this.
<br>
<strong>Describe your own Strengths and limitations?</strong><br>
As stated above and in the previous cores, my main limitations will my confidence and self esteem,<br>
 One more i will add though is my stuggle to externalize my iner thoughts when they come to my inner workings, <br>i have spent twice as long trying to get through the core programe as i have the technical side.<br> My main Strengths will be my empathy<br> and my ability to push through when i have my heart set on something.
</p>

<p><strong>How will you manage the workload of this programme?</strong><br>
  Its been about 8 years since ive last studied so it is already been a very big change for me but im trying my very best to change<br> my body clock and spend a set amount of time every day on this programe
  next week will be better than last<br> and the same goes for the following week.<br>
  Looking over slack i feel im the last person working on their blog pieces, i have really<br> struggled to get all my thoughts down, the technical side was easy and enjoyable.
  In saying that im happy with <br>what ive written finally and i think it all looks okay considering its my first time making a website.</p>

  <p><strong>How and where will you seek help?</strong><br>
    Once i have exhausted my own solutions i will move to google and if i still cant solve anything on my own i will then<br> seek help from my facilitator and cohort. From my facilitator and the team at EDA i expect <br>
    respect and honesty, If im falling behind and dont know it i would like to be told.
