  <h3> Identity, Values and Strengths </h3>
  <p>
    Questions like these stump me, I struggle with identity to be quite honest. My values are always evolving
    but i will forever be a person that holds compasionate, humble, creative people at high regard.
    My personality type is INFP a mediator, most of which i agree with. A mediator is Introverted, intuitive feeling over thinking,
    prospecting personality type.Im constatly seeking self improvment, i am open minded, although i can be quite quiet<br></P>

<p>
  <strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</strong><br>
    i emigrated from uk at the age of 12 this left me with a odd sense of culture/identity
    i dont really feel like im a "kiwi" or "pom" although this doesnt really bother me,
    i do however feel very lucky to live in such a beautiful country</p>
<p>
  <strong>Strengths</strong><br>
    My Strengths when it comes to learning and work will be my natural selflessness and willingness to empathize,
    i will quite often go out of my way entirely to help someone else out ,another Strength of mine is the ability to power through
    i may struggle with starting but once i get going im fine with very long days.<br>

<strong>Weaknesses</strong><br>
    My weaknesses will be self doubt and confidence, the self doubt is easily mitigated when i feel qualified in something.
    Condifence is something i have always struggled with when it comes to social settings, and i can find social interaction
    quite exhausting to be frank but im always working on it.</p>
