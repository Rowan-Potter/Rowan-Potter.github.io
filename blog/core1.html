  <h3><em>Identity, Values and Strengths</em></h3>
  <p>
    Questions like these stump me, I struggle with identity to be quite honest.<br> My values are always evolving
    but i will forever be a person that holds compasionate,<br> humble, creative people at high regard.
    My personality type is INFP a mediator, most of which <br>i agree with. A mediator is Introverted, intuitive feeling over thinking,
    prospecting <br>personality type. Im constatly seeking self improvment, i am open minded, although i can be quite quiet.<br></P>




<p>
  <strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</strong><br>
    I emigrated from uk at the age of 12 this left me with a odd sense of culture/identity<br>
    i dont really feel like im a "kiwi" or "pom" although this doesnt really bother me,<br>
    i do however feel very lucky to live in such a beautiful country.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Strengths</strong><br>
    My Strengths when it comes to learning and work will be my natural selflessness <br>and willingness to empathize,
    i will quite often go out of my way entirely to help<br> someone else out, i am a very hard worker and have the ability to power through.<br>

<strong>Weaknesses</strong><br>
    My weaknesses will be self doubt and confidence, the self doubt is easily mitigated<br> when i feel qualified in something.
    Although condifence is something i have always struggled <br>with when it comes to social settings, im working on it, i can find social interaction
    quite exhausting to be frank.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>How will your Strengths help with your learning journey</strong><br>
      My ability to power though and buckle down will help me though this,
      i think i have a good work ethic and will overcome whatever is thrown at me.</p>

        <strong>Share an example of where you were trying to work productively with others,<br> but there was resistance or tension.
          <br>Discuss the strategies you used at the time?</strong>
          <br>Coming from a hospo background this is a daily occurrence,
          it was very common for it <br>to be an extreamly busy survice yet someone isnt quite pulling their weight,
          from my<br> experience its important to take a step back and to communicate to them in and ordered<br>
          fasion to not blame anyone or belittle but to remind them you can get through this,
          to hype them up almost <br>and enject some energy into the situation . Getting angry or frustrated will
          make it a million times more difficult for everyone </p>
          <p><strong>Explain a situation where you had a ethical decision to make?</strong><br>
            This may be Cliche but two weeks at a supermarket carpark it was awfull windy, a man was loading <br>his groceries into his car
            $20 dollars flew out of his back pocket and landed basically at my feet, <br>he was pretty much gone he was hoping into his car and putting on his seatbelt.<br>
            As someone who doesnt get paid the most and has struggled i didnt question not waving him down,<br>
            i chased him down to give him back his $20 he patted down his back pocket and thanked me with a surprised look. <br>
            No other action occured to me. I didnt realise this was and ethical decision till i was racking my brain looking for one
